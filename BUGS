Known problems
--------------

When you maximize KPlayer window, then go to full screen mode, then back
to maximized state, and then restore the window to normal state, the final
size may not be the same as the original size. Also sometimes the window
will be larger than its original size after coming back from full screen
mode. This is believed to be a KWin problem.

Seeking does not work well on some media types, in particular DVDs, VCDs
and some Windows Media files. In those cases you can try using the
Forward/Backward commands instead of clicking on the slider itself or
dragging the slider thumb. Also the detected length may not be correct
in some cases, especially on DVDs, VCDs and variable bitrate files. Some
files are not seekable at all. This is an MPlayer problem.
