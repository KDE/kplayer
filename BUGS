Known problems
--------------

Problems when coming back from full screen mode have been fixed.

Seeking still does not work well on some media types. In those cases you
can try using the Forward/Backward commands instead of clicking on the
progress slider or dragging the slider thumb. Also the detected length may
not be correct in some cases, especially on variable bitrate files. Some
files are not seekable at all. This is an MPlayer problem.

After playing from slow media like optical disks, some MPlayer processes
may be left behind. Run killall mplayer to kill them.

Resizing is not very smooth and causes flickering of the video area and
other parts of the program. Aspect ratio is not maintained while resizing
the window continuously.

Some actions in the Configure Shortcuts and Configure Toolbars dialogs
have the same name when in fact they are different actions. This is
presently a kdelibs limitation.
