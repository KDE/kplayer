Known problems
--------------

When you maximize KPlayer window, then go to full screen mode, then back
to maximized state, and then restore the window to normal state, the final
size may not be the same as the original size. Also sometimes the window
will be larger than its original size after coming back from full screen
mode. This is believed to be a KWin problem. KPlayer 0.6.1 includes a
change that should correct this problem for the most part.

Seeking still does not work well on some media types. In those cases you
can try using the Forward/Backward commands instead of clicking on the
progress slider or dragging the slider thumb. Also the detected length may
not be correct in some cases, especially on variable bitrate files. Some
files are not seekable at all. This is an MPlayer problem.
